## It's Prisma Time - Create Db

Hi Guys ðŸ‘‹
welcome back.
Finally, today it's time to create our database, so don't waste time, and get started.
How can you create your database?
It's simple! You have to run the following script:
```
npx prisma db push
```
This script creates in your `prisma` folder a SQLite database called `dev.db`.
The database's name is taken from the variable `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file and inside of the file you can find the next table.

Ok, now you have your database so it's time to get back at the challenge left open last article.
Run the script
```
yarn dev
```
```console
{ posts: [] }
```

Ok, there aren't data but it works ðŸ¥³
So now you have a database and you can search data inside it, at this point, it's time to create relations between our entities, but it's the goal of the next article ðŸ¤ª

That's all for today guys!
See you soon
Bye Bye ðŸ‘‹
